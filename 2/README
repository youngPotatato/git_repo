		Title: 			SystemVerilog Demo fifo
 
		Objective: 		To Demonstrate advantage of systemverilog over verilog
		Description: 	Inorder to illustrate the constructs of Systemverilog, a Synchronous FIFO (4 x 16 bit words) has been chosen. 

		Additional setup: None	

	To run the Example:
			make test1 (or)  make comp1 run1  --> Compiles and Runs the Verilog only design and testbench.
			make test2 (or)  make comp2 run2 --> Compiles and runs the modified Verilog design to introduce structures
			make test3 (or)  make comp3 run3 --> Compiles and runs the modified Verilog design to introduce interfaces


	 Using Shell Scripts:
		comp1.csh & run1.csh -- Compiles and Runs the Verilog only design and testbench	
		comp2.csh & run2.csh -- Compiles and runs the modified Verilog design to introduce structures
		comp3.csh & run3.csh --  Compiles and runs the modified Verilog design to introduce interfaces
